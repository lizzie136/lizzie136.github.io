Hi, my name is Elizabeth Portilla. I am a software engineer currently working remotely from NYC. 
I work as a front-end engineer at @kiddom. Previously, I worked as a software engineer for US-based clients at @BairesDev, and as a JavaScript full-stack engineer and head coach/instructor for the JavaScript track at @Laboratoria. However, I consider myself more of a learner than a teacher.

If you are here, maybe you're interested in some of the open projects I have: 

- A [translation to Spanish](https://lizzie136.github.io/tdd-js-spanish/) of: ***A gentle introduction to JavaScript Test Driven Development*** by **J. Sinclair**

Or maybe you're interested in some [open projects](https://github.com/Laboratoria) from [Laboratoria](http://laboratoria.la). 
Maybe you want to know more about [LimaJS.org](https://limajs.org),
[FrontEnd Foxes](https://www.vuevixens.org) or
[Global Diversity Call For Papers Day](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com) which are some of the organizations I collaborate with.

I also make music ðŸŽµ [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6GF9i5WFH11f3clx2L2Ed9?si=caKqU4c9R1uFT6sWT-cxsg), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/pe/artist/lizzie136-elizabeth-portilla/1501001723?l=en), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/lizzie136)

See ya! :)
