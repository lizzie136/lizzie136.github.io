Hi, my name is Elizabeth Portilla. I'm a Software Engineer based Lima, Peru. 

Currently, I work at Laboratoria as Teacher for the JavaScript track, but I'm more like a learner. 

If you are here, maybe you're interested in some of the open projects I have: 

- A [translation to Spanish](https://lizzie136.github.io/tdd-js-spanish/) of: ***A gentle introduction to JavaScript Test Driven Development*** by **J. Sinclair**

Or maybe you're interested in some [open projects](https://github.com/Laboratoria) from [Laboratoria](http://laboratoria.la).

See ya! :)
